### Little story

I used to have many conexion issue previously but after some search on google and I stumbled about this [Windowsreport article](https://windowsreport.com/dns-issues-windows-10/). I tried thier solution and it worked for me so I though that it was a good idea to create a batch script who will automaticlly execute commands instead of typing them one by one.
