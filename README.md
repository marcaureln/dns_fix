### The little story

I used to have many conexion issue previously but after some search on google and I stumbled about this [Windowsreport article](https://windowsreport.com/dns-issues-windows-10/). I tried thier solution and it worked for me so I though that it was a good idea to create a batch script who will automaticlly execute commands instead of typing them one by one.

## Usage

1. Download the repository
2. Unzip the archive
3. Save your work because **your computer will restart!**
4. Run `dns_fix.bat` as administator
5. It's done !

**Note:** You can also run the `dns_fix_no_reboot` script if you won't restart your computer
